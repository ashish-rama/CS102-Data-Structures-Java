Hello!
This is Ashish Ramachandranâ€™s (ar3986) README for CS102 Data Structures (Evan Korth) Assignment 3.

Note: The logic for my work is in the javadocs for all the newly written methods and class (FastMaxStack.java). Included is also all of the classes needed for my program to run. The runtimeAnalysis is also in the .zip file.
