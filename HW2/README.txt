Hello!
This is Ashish Ramachandranâ€™s (ar3986) README for CS102 Data Structures (Evan Korth) Assignment 2.

Note: The main method is already in the Sieve class. The logic for my work is in the javadoc for the primesTo(int n) method in the Sieve class. Included is also all of the classes needed for my program to run.
