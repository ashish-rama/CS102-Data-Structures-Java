Hello!
This is Ashish Ramachandran’s (ar3986) README for CS102 Data Structures (Evan Korth) Assignment 6.

Note: I have followed and added each of the methods from the assignment page to the HuffmanConverter class. I added a few small things for formatting the output such as actually printing out “\n” instead of just a new line. Additionally, when printing the Huffman codes for the characters, I made it so it prints 5 character’s information per line.
